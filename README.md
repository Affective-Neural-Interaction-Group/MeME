# MeME
The Multisubject Face Memory EEG dataset

The datasets are available at https://osf.io/dhuvs/ (.fif) and https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WvTVDZMGlT02J1Jegsd0-lWGvdXHT4j9/view?usp=drive_link (.set).

To get started with the dataset, please see the description below.


# Description
## Data format
### The raw data (*.mff).
The raw data were collected through EGIâ€™s Net Station software, which saves files in Metafile Format (MFF), which can be exported to the EDF+ format, MATLAB, EEGLAB, FieldTrip, or your own custom software.
- We cannot upload the file for the file size limit. Please contact us to get the raw data.

### Half-preprocessed data (*.set).
Data were half-preprocessed using a MATLAB toolbox, EEGLAB, and datasets were saved as a .set file. 
This included a 0.2 ~ 80 Hz band-pass filter and a 45~55 Hz notch filter.

### Epoched data (*.fif).
Half pre-processed datasets were epoched through MNE Python and saved as a *.fif file. 
Each epoch compromises 1000 ms, including 200 ms of baseline activity and 800 ms of post-stimulus recording.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 is supported.

- Pytorch >= 1.4.0.
  
- Set up python environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate brainprompt
```

### Vectorizing epochs

Convert the epochs data to machine learning tasks compatible tensors:
```
python vectorizing_epochs.py
```


### Classification

Perform the binary classification task of distinguishing target and non-target epochs:
```
python classification.py
```

### Image synthesis

Generate the single-subject memory updated facial image:
```
python single_subject_synthesis.py
```

Generate the multi-subject memory updated facial image:
```
python multi_subject_synthesis.py
```

Some additional files we provide:
- Labels of images detected by each subject for each trial. 
- Latent codes of images with corresponding labels.
